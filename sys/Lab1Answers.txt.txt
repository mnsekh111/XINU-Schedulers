What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two scheduling policies and the original scheduling policy in XINU?


LINUX like Scheduler (Advantages)
1) There is no starvation as every runnable process gets its share in an epoch.
2) It has better turn around time.
3) This scheduler gives greater opportunity for blocked processes to complete their quantum.

LINUX like Scheduler (Disadvantages)

1) If a process goes to blocked state, then the quantum that remains in previous epoch is carried to next epoch. So this can 
lead to gaming of scheduler as the programmer can voluntarily relinquish cpu to get more quantums next time.
2) This scheduler switches between processes very frequently and hence there is high overhead because of context switching.


DEFAULT Scheculer (Advantages)
1)Whenever a higher priority process enters the system, it will be directly given cpu. Hence response time for high
priority processes (User interactive processes have high priority) is practivally 0. 

DEFAULT Scheduler (Disadvantages)
1) Low priority process face huge starvation as they might never get a chance new high
priority processes are continuously generated.
2) Turnaround time for low priority process will be large.

MULTIQUEUE Scheduler (Advantages)
1) Realtime process are maintained in a separate queue and hence executed more frequently there by reducing their response and 
turn around time
2) Normal processes are not blocked by the realtime processes with high priority as they too get some fair share of cpu.

MULTIQUEUE Scheduler (Disadvantages)
1) The processes in the realtime queue are given equal quantms and there is no strict ordering among them.
2) A normal process can have priority greater than any other process in the real time queue. This process will always remain in the
normal queue and hence will have high turn around time
3) Round robin algorithm for real time processes may increase context switching cost.

NOTE TO THE GRADER : Test case 9 hangs a bit.
